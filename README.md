Drawly
======

Technically this app will compile in any OS that Qt 5 supports, given you have a C++11 compliant compiler. I heavily rely on lambdas, foreach loops, auto, some smart pointers and other C++11 goodness. Below is the original UML class diagram I drew up in WhiteStarUML before implementation:

This app has been tested in Windows 10 and Manjaro Linux.
